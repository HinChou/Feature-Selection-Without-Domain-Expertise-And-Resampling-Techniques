# Feature-Selection-Without-Domain-Expertise-And-Resampling-Techniques
Realize Several Feature Selection Methods without Haveing Domain Expertise and Realize Two Classes of Resampling Techniques

Feature Selection Methods:

* Removing Features with Low Variance    
*  Univariate Feature Selection
*  Recursive Feature Elimination    
* Feature Selection Using SelectFromMode

Resampling Techniques:
* Random Over-sampling
* Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique(SMOTE)
