# Feature-Selection-Without-Domain-Expertise-And-Resampling-Techniques
Realize Several Feature Selection Methods without Haveing Domain Expertise and Realize Two Classes of Resampling Techniques

Feature Selection Methods:

* Removing Features with Low Variance    
*  Univariate Feature Selection
*  Recursive Feature Elimination(Running time and Accuracy Trade off)   
* Feature Selection Using SelectFromMode

Resampling Techniques:
* Random Over-sampling
* Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique(SMOTE)


***
The SMOTE oversamples the rare event by using bootstrapping and k-nearest neighbor to synthetically create additional observations of that event. The definition of rare event is usually attributed to any outcome/dependent/target/response variable that happens less than 15% of the time.

Next thing I want to add into this repository is the methods of missing value imputation. I will come back to this later.
* Mean and Median Imputaion
* Multiple Imputaion
* EM Imputation
* Other Imputation Methods

Advantages and disadvantages among the methods listing above...
